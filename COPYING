CS2J has two components:

- CSharpTranslator:
     This builds the cs2j.exe executable.  This executable runs
     directly under Windows and under Mono on other platforms
     (http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page).

     With this licensing then the produced Java code should be
     completely unencumbered and you can do what you want with it.

- CS2JLibrary: 

     This contains the XML translation files that direct CS2J to
     translate .Net framework calls into appropriate Java code, and
     the CS2JLibrary Java support library that translated applications
     include.
