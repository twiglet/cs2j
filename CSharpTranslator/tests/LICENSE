This directory contains various C# snippets used to test aspects of CS2J.

The code has come from various places, as far as I know it is all freely 
distributable (most is very short extracts). It may not be under a permissive
license though. Let me know if you wish me to include attribution, copyright 
statements, or for code to be removed from this section.
