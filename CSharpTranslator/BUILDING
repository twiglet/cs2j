CS2J can be built on Windows (requires .Net framework 4 to be
installed), or on any system that supports Mono
(http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page) and Ant
(http://ant.apache.org/).

The solution file in src/ should load in Visual Studio 2010 or
MonoDevelop, or you can build from the command line by running
'mkit.bat' (Windows) or mkit (mono).  This will build a cs2j.exe
executable in src\CS2JTranslator\bin\Debug\cs2j.exe.

Documentation for cs2j.exe is in docs\external\CS2JUsersGuide.pdf.
